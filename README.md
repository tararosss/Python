# Python - Instacart Analysis
I used Python to wrangle and analyze several datasets for Instacart.  I then created a report that communicates my analysis process and my results and recommendations to key business questions from Instacart.

## Objective
In this project, I take on the role of an analyst for Instacart to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to shcedule ads at times when there are fewers orders/
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags.  Marketing and sales want to use simpiler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?  The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing team and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
   - What's the distribution amoung users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
   - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
   - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
   - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
   - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family Status?

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathimatical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations


## Folders
The project files are stored in the following folder structure:
- *01 Project Management*: Project Brief
- *02 Data*: Separated into two subfolders Original Data which contained the original data frames and Prepared Data contain the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis. (Data files not uploaded to Github due to size limitations.)
- *03 Scripts*: Juptyer notebooks containing coding for the analysis.
- *04 Analysis*: The visualizations subfolder contains the visuals used for developing and explaining insights.
- *05 Sent to Client*: The final report presented in Excel.

## Resources
Note: Instacart is a real company that's made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief have been fabricated by CareerFoundry for the purpose of this analysis.
